# CDGMP3-to-MKV
Batch convert your CDG+MP3 collection to MKV video files

I wrote this script to convert my collection of old CDG & MP3 dual files to a single MKV video file, which is better supported by newer apps and connected TV apps like Plex after not finding any decent apps supporting the old format.
It will retain the subdirectory layout, so you can convert a single folder with lots of subdirectories and keep the same organizational structure.

Requirements:
Make sure ffmpeg is installed and accessible.

Usage:
cdgmp32mkv.py /input_path/ /output_path/
